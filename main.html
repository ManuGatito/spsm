                    <h4>1. Project Ownership</h4>
                    <p> 1.1 Every project that has the explicit likeliness of the<br /> SPSM or that contains a mark from SPSM will become<br /> owned by the SPSM. That means, that if the project<br /> contains another project that is owned by the SPSM<br /> or if the project contains the SPSM logo, partially or<br /> completely, it will become property of the SPSM.</p>
                    <p> 1.2 The SPSM, is NOT allowed and can NOT claim the<br /> credits for a project, and there is not a single case, in<br /> which the project credits and ownership belong to<br /> the SPSM.</p>
                    <p> 1.3 The projects owned by the SPSM are owned by<br /> the company and NO individual from the company<br /> can claim credit for the work done, UNLESS that<br /> individual is the creator of the project or a person<br /> whose contribution is explicitly written in the<br /> %22Instructions%22 or %22Notes and Credits%22 section of a<br /> project.</p>
                    <p>1.4 In every project owned by the SPSM, the original<br /> author has the right to do everything with his project,<br /> since it will always belongs to them. However, the<br /> SPSM has the right to use it as trademark, and do<br /> anything with it, except: a) Altering the project. b) De-<br /> nigrating the project or disrespecting it. c) Claiming the<br /> credits for the EFFORT and CREATION of a project.</p>
